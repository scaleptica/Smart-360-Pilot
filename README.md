# Smart-360-Pilot

This project takes a 360 degree panoramic video as input and uses CV to
automatically dewarp and crop the video to a normal video format

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:
1. An input video (360 panoramic mp4) goes in the input directory. A sample video
has already been placed for you.

2. The program runs by running the main.py file

3. The output is produced in the output folder

VARIOUS SPORTING 360 VIDEOS AND THEIR OUTPUTS AFTER RUNNING THROUGH OUR CODE
HAVE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO SEE IN THE 'RESULTS OF CODE FOLDER'

PS: The project was a group effort
